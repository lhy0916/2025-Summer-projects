# Python Weather Tracker GUI

**Built with:** Python, Tkinter, REST API integration

## ðŸ“– Project Overview
This is a **real-time weather tracker application** developed in Python using the Tkinter GUI library.  
It retrieves live weather data through the **OpenWeatherMap API**, converting user-provided city names into geographical coordinates and displaying detailed conditions including:

- Temperature
- Humidity
- Pressure
- Wind speed
- Cloudiness
- Visibility
- Local time adjusted for the cityâ€™s timezone

---

## âœ¨ Key Features
- **API Key Entry:** Users can enter their own OpenWeatherMap API key directly into the app.
- **City Search:** Type any city name to retrieve weather details.
- **Unit Toggle:** Switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
- **Geocoding:** Automatic conversion of city names to latitude/longitude via OpenWeatherMapâ€™s geocoding API.
- **Local Time:** Displays a live clock adjusted for the cityâ€™s timezone offset.
- **Recent Searches:** Dropdown menu for quick access to recently searched cities.
- **Responsive GUI:** Clean, user-friendly interface for fast interaction.
- **Dual Unit Support:** Supports both metric and imperial units.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Experience
This project was a significant part of my **self-directed learning** process:
- I began by **reading and understanding sample code templates**.
- Gradually modified and expanded the code to match **real-world functionality** I wanted to implement.
- Focused on **reverse engineering** and **code adaptation** rather than following a step-by-step tutorial.
- Strengthened my skills in **Python fundamentals**, **GUI programming**, and **real-time API integration**.

## ðŸ›  Technical Details
**Backend:**
- Uses OpenWeatherMapâ€™s **weather** and **geocoding** endpoints.
- Handles API requests and JSON parsing to extract relevant data.

**Frontend:**
- Built entirely with Pythonâ€™s built-in **Tkinter** library.
- Implements labels, dropdown menus, entry fields, and toggle buttons.
