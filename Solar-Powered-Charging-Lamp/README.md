# Smart Solar Powered Lamp

## Overview
This project is a fully self-sustaining solar-powered lighting system built with **Arduino**, designed to operate autonomously for off-grid use.  
It uses a **5V solar panel** for energy harvesting, a **TP4056 lithium battery charging module** for battery management, and an **MT3608 boost converter** to ensure consistent power output for the microcontroller and connected components.

## How It Works
1. **Solar Charging**  
   The 5V solar panel charges the 3.7V Li-ion battery through the TP4056 module.
2. **Voltage Boosting**  
   The MT3608 boost converter raises the voltage to the required level for the Arduino and LED lamp.
3. **Battery Monitoring**  
   A voltage divider feeds battery voltage to an Arduino analog pin, allowing the system to calculate battery percentage.
4. **Ambient Light Detection**  
   An LDR, connected via a resistor voltage divider, measures light intensity.
5. **Automatic Lamp Control**  
   - Lamp turns **on** when ambient light is below the set threshold **and** battery voltage is above 3.3V.
   - Lamp stays **off** in daylight or if the battery is too low, to conserve energy.
6. **LCD Display**  
   Displays battery voltage, battery percentage, and system status in real time.
